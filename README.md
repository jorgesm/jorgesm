# Hi! I'm [Jorge](https://jorgesm.com/) üëã

An aerospace engineer in the world of data analysis and product management. I'm from Spain, living in Valencia.

## üöÄ Interests

Besides coding, I'm interested in the financial world and constantly learning about the stock market and portfolio optimizations. I'm also interested in AI and machine learning, and I'm currently exploring large language models and their applications.  

Always looking for the next challenge! üîçüëÄ
